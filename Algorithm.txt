ALGORITHM

1. Data Cleaning
	- Converted Dates to Quarterly periods.
	- Converted Duration to Seconds count using regular expressions.
	- Category was concerted to numerical variables using label encoder
	- Some Rows contained "F" letter. So those rows were removed.
	- All data was converted to int64
2. Data Training
	- Trained the data on Random Forest as a regressor using 1000 trees.
3. Prediction
	- Made ad_views prediction using the developed model.
